    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Many newcomer families face language, financial, cultural, and systemic barriers that limit their children’s and youths’ access to extracurricular and recreational opportunities. These limitations can lead to social isolation, hinder language development, and negatively affect mental and emotional well-being.</p>

    <p>The <strong> Pathways to Belonging</strong> program addresses these challenges by providing accessible and culturally responsive programming tailored specifically to the needs of Sudanese newcomer children and youth.</p>

    <p>This initiative offers a safe, welcoming environment where youth can participate in physical, recreational, and creative activities that promote teamwork, improve language skills, and build confidence. For younger children, structured play and guided community engagement help foster friendships and a sense of belonging.</p>

    <p>By supporting the holistic development of newcomer youth, the program strengthens families and promotes inclusive communities. It reduces social marginalization and empowers young newcomers to become confident, connected, and contributing members of society.</p>

    <h2>Key Outcomes the Project Aims to Achieve</h2>

    <h3>Skill Development and Capacity Building</h3>
    <p>Workshops and organized activities help build communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills. These empower participants to seize academic and social opportunities, supporting long-term success.</p>

    <h3>Enhanced Social Integration and Sense of Belonging</h3>
    <p>Through structured opportunities to explore the community and interact with peers, participants build relationships and feel more connected. This reduces isolation and promotes mutual understanding with the wider community.</p>

    <h3>Government Subsidy Funding Available</h3>
