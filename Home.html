      <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he <strong>Pathways to Belonging</strong> program is designed to create a welcoming, inclusive, and supportive environment for newcomer 
        children and youth in Calgary. We especially support those arriving from Sudan, a region currently affected by civil war. These families face challenges like financial strain, language barriers,
        and cultural disconnection. Parents often support extended families back home while adjusting to life in Canada, making their childrenâ€™s social and emotional integration even more important.</p>
